# CollisionSimulation
Simulation of isotropic collision trajectories for Tanaka & Clark (2021) bioRxiv

### How to run the simulation

Clone the repository to your local computer. Simply running `simulate_collision()` function should replicate the collision risk plot in the paper.
The simulation was developed on Matlab 2019b and requires the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
